# My Year of Undergraduate Studies

This is where I have documented what I studied during one year of undergraduate education.  
Here, I learned **Machine Learning**, **Data Analysis and Visualization**, and **Deep Learning**.

The codes above are from exams and assignments given by the school.  
The file names are assigned based on the subject they correspond to.  

If you're curious about what I learned in each subject, refer to the file names and choose a file to explore.
